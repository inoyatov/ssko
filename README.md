# Simple Client Side SSH Key Organizer for Developers

At work I am working with more than 60 devices over SSH. And remembering all 
by IP address is not possible. So I wrote this simple shell script in order
to create ssh keys and orginize it under `~/.ssh/` folder.

## Installation
In order to install type following in terminal:
```
# sudo make install
```

## Uninstallation
In order to remove script type following in terminal:
```
# sudo make uninstall
```

## Usage
In order to run script type following any working direcotry:
```
# ssko
```

And it will ask several question and configure ssh key for usage.
